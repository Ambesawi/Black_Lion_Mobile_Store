##server.js and app.js function

You should create a separate JavaScript file (e.g., app.js) to handle the client-side logic for fetching and displaying data on your HTML page. The server-side logic, which is in server.js, handles the server operations and routing.

Here's a quick breakdown of the responsibilities:

server.js: Handles server-side logic, routing, and communicates with MongoDB.

app.js: Handles client-side logic, such as making requests to server endpoints (like /products), receiving data, and updating the HTML page dynamically.
## Conclusion:
We are excited to embark on this project, and we look forward to overcoming challenges, acquiring new skills, and delivering a robust and user-friendly mobile store web application.
